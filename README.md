# HousePrice-EDA-Modelling
Exploratory Data Analysis and build Linear regression model to predict house price from a set of house sales data from a residential real estate market

In this project, I will perform extensive Exploratory Data Analysis on a set of house sales data from a residential real estate market. Based on the findings in EDA, I will build a linear regression model to predict the sales price of a house.

There are 2 datasets for this project. The first data is training.csv which contains all the data I need to train the model on. testing.csv contains the data that I will use to test the performance of the model that I built.
